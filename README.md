# FitBack

FitBack is a *prototype* of an AR application written in **React Native** that helps people who want to train at home without a human personal trainer. It tries to teach the correct way to perform physical exercises. FitBack can interact with the user while he is performing an exercise and correct him. 

The project was implemented in a group team, for the "Human Computer Interaction" university course.
